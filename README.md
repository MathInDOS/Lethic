# Lethic
Lethic is source file of Clxcq Physletric malware. The author who've created Physletric doing basically Copy and Paste as the real source of Physletric is more like junk. I've do some improvements for more readablity to this code.

# Not included yet
I've not included bytebeat sound effects in this code, all are GDI source, even it's almost same, you may find some payloads are missing, as I've not include to it. 
This program is comfortable with TDM-GCC compiler, haven't yet test with MSVC and expected warnings either errors while you'll trying to compile with MSVC.
To compile with MSVC, you need to change some of code sections with your choice.

# Payloads and conclusion
Included `18` payloads, and haven't include `MBR overwrite and some of external payloads`. The 18th payload was copied from Nikitpad by Clxcq (author).
